INT. CORLEONE ESTATE - WEDDING DAY - AFTERNOON

    VITO CORLEONE, the venerable and respected Godfather, stands by the wedding cake, a cigar in one hand, a glass of scotch in the other. He’s in conversation with his YOUNGEST SON, MICHAEL, a decorated WWII Marine, who seems aloof and uninterested. 

    VITO
    Michael, this isn’t just about the family business. It’s about tradition, respect, loyalty...

    MICHAEL
    (Interrupts)
    I know, Pop. I’ve heard it all before. 

    VITO
    (Sighs, looks at Michael with concern)
    This isn’t the life you want, is it?

    MICHAEL
    No, Pop, it isn’t.

    Suddenly, a TREACHEROUS RIVAL, VIRGIL SOLLOZZO, interrupts their conversation. Sollozzo’s eyes are cold, calculating. 

    SOLLOZZO
    (Greets Vito)
    Don Corleone, a moment of your time, if you please. 

    VITO
    (Nods)
    Sollozzo. What brings you here?

    SOLLOZZO
    (Leans in)
    I have a proposition, Don. The kind that could make us all very wealthy men. 

    VITO
    (Raises an eyebrow)
    Go on.

    SOLLOZZO
    (Smirks)
    Drugs, Don Corleone. The future. 

    VITO
    (Shakes his head)
    No, Sollozzo. That’s not our way.

    SOLLOZZO
    (Leans back, surprised)
    You reject my offer?

    VITO
    (Firmly)
    I reject your offer. 

    Sollozzo leaves, a storm brewing in his eyes. Vito turns to Michael, a hint of worry in his eyes.

    VITO
    (Seriously)
    Michael, there are some battles that we cannot avoid, no matter how much we may want to.

    MICHAEL
    (Nods, understanding)
    I understand, Pop.

    VITO
    (Looks at Michael)
    I hope you do, son. I hope you do.

    FADE OUT.
